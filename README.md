This example demonstrates a common issue in Perl where the order of hash iteration is undefined.  The output of the program is not guaranteed to be consistent across different Perl versions or even different runs on the same system. This can lead to subtle bugs and unexpected behavior in applications that rely on a specific iteration order. The solution demonstrates a way to maintain order if needed.
